All events for SLAMM will be held at Reiman Gardens on the campus of Iowa State University on Friday April 20.  In addition to the papers from the faculty presenters, there will be a poster session for graduate students.  We may have limited funding to support students who present their work.  As part of the registration process, you will be asked to submit a title and abstract of your poster and a name of a reference.  Please have these ready when you register. 

We encourage you to attend this event which includes a social function as well as a lot of great methodology talks. SLAMM! is free to attend, but registration is required for accurate head-count numbers for meals and entertainment.
